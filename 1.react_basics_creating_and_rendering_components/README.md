<p><strong>React components</strong> are the fundamental building blocks of a React application. They encapsulate logic, structure, and even style into reusable pieces that can be combined to build complex user interfaces.</p>
<p>When naming a component, it's important to note that it HAS to start with an uppercase!</p>
<h4>Key Features of React Components:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Components can be reused throughout an application, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.</li>
<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: Each component manages its own state and rendering logic, ensuring modularity.</li>
<li><strong>Composability</strong>: Components can be composed together to form more complex UI elements and application structures.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>: Components enable developers to separate different parts of the UI into distinct, manageable pieces.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functional Components</strong>: In modern React, components are functions that return UI elements.</li>
<li><strong>Class Components</strong>: However, in legacy code, you may encounter components created with classes with an OOP approach in design. This is still supported but not longer suggested for new apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each component represents a part of the user interface and can be as small as a button or as large as a complete page layout. These components can be nested within each other to build more complex UIs.</p>
