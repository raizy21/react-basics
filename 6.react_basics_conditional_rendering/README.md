<p>Conditional rendering refers to, well, rendering a particular output or UI element based on a given condition.</p>
<p>This is where React really shows its strength: React can respond to changes in the data within our app and render the appropriate version of the UI for a given state of said data!</p>
<p>There's no special syntax to declare conditions, so you can use different approaches!</p>
